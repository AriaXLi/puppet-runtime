2018/10/04 - Bryan Jen, Puppet Inc.

This patch to the Ruby batch file generation is necessary when packaging
Ruby with Puppet's vanagon package builder, as used by Puppet agent,
Bolt, and PDK. When the msi installer is built, the path generated for
the installed Ruby cannot be assumed to be the same as the path in
the build environment. For that reason, we need this patch to use the
executables from the current working directory, so that it is always
using the vendored ruby installation.
