Notes

No more cargo-culted knowledge!

The notes directory contains notes on the idiosyncrasies of specific platforms and how we needed to work around them to make builds work.  Essentially this is the place to put your notes on why strange patches exist or weird flags were passed on some platform.

The notes directory is sorted by platform.
